This is a model meant to diagnose prostate cancer
Problem description
Determining what a patient is suffering from a screen image is quite complicated for doctors, many times they might diagnose patients with the wrong sickness but if Artificial intelligence were used to determine sicknesses from screen images, there would be 99% accuracy.
Determining what disease someone is suffering from is quite complicated in the current world, a person has to get tested and if discovered not to be suffering from the disease tested for, testing is carried out for other sickness, if they are found to have non, it becomes heard to determine what they are suffering from and exactly which medication suits the person.
At times patients are misdiagnosed. 
A serious example is Ted Blackwell who was misdiagnosed by doctors from a Kaiser clinic in California with headache yet it was cerebral bleeding he was actually suffering from.
